I installed Ubuntu alongside Windows 11.

Here's how I did it:

### ðŸ”§ Tools I Used:
- Rufus (to create the bootable USB)
- Ubuntu ISO
- Disk Management (in Windows) to shrink the partition
- Flash Drive

### ðŸª› Steps I Followed:
1. Downloaded Ubuntu ISO from the official website
2. Created bootable USB using Rufus
3. Shrunk my C:\ partition to make space
4. Disabled BitLocker (so Windows wouldn't lock or fail to boot after installing Linux)
5. Booted from USB and installed Ubuntu in the free partition
6. Restarted and now I can choose between Windows and Ubuntu!

This is my first experience with Linux, and Iâ€™m excited to explore more!
