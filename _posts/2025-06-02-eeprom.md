## What is EEPROM?

EEPROM stands for *Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory*. It is a type of non-volatile memory used in microcontrollers to store small amounts of data that must be saved when power is lost.

Iâ€™ve used EEPROM in a couple of my previous IoT projects.

## EEPROM C++ Class for Read/Write Operations

Here's a simple C++ class I use to read and write data to an EEPROM device over I2C:

EEPROM header file:
~~~
// EEPROM.h

#ifndef EEPROM_H
#define EEPROM_H

#include <cstring>
#include "hardware/i2c.h"

#define EEPROM_ADDRESS 0x50
#define I2C i2c0
#define ADDRESS_SIZE 2

class EEPROM {
public:
    EEPROM(uint16_t address, const void *data, size_t length);
    void eeprom_write_state(void *write_data);
    void eeprom_read_state();
    void eeprom_read_write(void *write_data);

private:
    uint16_t state_address;
    const void *data;
    size_t length;
    i2c_inst_t *i2c;
    uint8_t eeprom_address;
    size_t address_size;
};

#endif // EEPROM_H

~~~

EEPROM cpp file:

~~~
#include "EEPROM.h"

EEPROM::EEPROM(uint16_t address, const void *data, size_t length)
    : state_address(address), data(data), length(length), i2c(I2C), eeprom_address(EEPROM_ADDRESS), address_size(ADDRESS_SIZE) {}

void EEPROM::eeprom_write_state(void *write_data) {
    uint8_t buffer[address_size + length];
    buffer[0] = (state_address >> 8) & 0xFF;
    buffer[1] = state_address & 0xFF;
    memcpy(&buffer[2], write_data, length);
    i2c_write_blocking(i2c, eeprom_address, buffer, sizeof(buffer), false);
    sleep_ms(50);
}

void EEPROM::eeprom_read_state() {
    uint8_t addr_buffer[address_size];
    addr_buffer[0] = (state_address >> 8) & 0xFF;
    addr_buffer[1] = state_address & 0xFF;
    i2c_write_blocking(i2c, eeprom_address, addr_buffer, 2, true);
    i2c_read_blocking(i2c, eeprom_address, (uint8_t *)data, length, false);
}

~~~

I have this member function in my .cpp file to avoid calling write and read functions separately.
~~~
void EEPROM::eeprom_read_write(void *write_data) {
    eeprom_write_state(write_data);
    eeprom_read_state();
}
~~~

Here is the main:

~~~
#include "main.h"

//These macros and variables are defined in main.h, shown here for clarity.
#define EEPROM_ADDRESS 0x50
#define DOOR_STATE 0x0000

// Variable to hold door state read from EEPROM
uint8_t door_state_data = 0xFF;

// Door states
uint8_t door_open = 0x00;
uint8_t door_close = 0x01;
uint8_t door_between = 0x02;

// Create EEPROM object with address, data pointer, and data size
EEPROM door_state_obj(DOOR_STATE, &door_state_data, sizeof(door_state_data));


// Write "door_close" state to EEPROM
door_state_obj.eeprom_write_state(&door_close);

// Read current door state from EEPROM into door_state_data
door_state_obj.eeprom_read_state();

// Use this to read and write together when needed
door_state_obj.eeprom_read_write(&door_open);
