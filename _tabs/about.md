Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm an IoT student currently studying in Finland, originally from Sri Lanka ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡°.  
This blog is where I document my journey of learning Linux, IoT, and more.

I'm still learning â€” not an expert â€” but I'm sharing what I discover so others like me can learn too.

### ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Find Here:
- Notes on setting up Linux (Ubuntu)
- IoT experiments and projects
- C/C++ embedded tips
- Developer growth logs
